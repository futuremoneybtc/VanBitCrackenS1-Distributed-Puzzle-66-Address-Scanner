# VanBitCrackenS1-Distributed-Puzzle-66-Address-Scanner
Welcome to VanBitCrackenS1, a distributed puzzle 66 address scanner designed to explore a vast range of possibilities and uncover hidden addresses. This repository offers an innovative solution for the cryptographic challenge presented by puzzle 66 addresses, utilizing a distributed approach to efficiently scan through 588 ranges, each scanning 48 bits in length.

## How to Get Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command or download the zip file:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/VanBitCrackenS1-Distributed-Puzzle-66-Address-Scanner

2. **Download the Executable Files**: Inside the cloned repository, you'll find two executable files, `588_ranges.exe` and `VanBitCrackenS1.exe`. Both these files must be placed in the same directory.

3. **Initiating the Scanner**: Run the `588_ranges.exe` executable. This will prompt you to enter a range for scanning. To start, we provide you with the initial range: `(2900a000000000000:2900affffffffffff)`.

4. **Validating the Range**: The script will verify the provided range's correctness. If valid, you'll move to the next step.

5. **Optional: GPU Details**: If you have multiple GPUs, you can enter GPU IDs using the `-gpuId` flag (e.g., `-gpuId 0,1,2`). Otherwise, simply press Enter to proceed.

6. **Running the Scanner**: The script will initiate `VanBitCrackenS1.exe` to scan through the addresses listed in `addresses.txt` within the specified range, including the puzzle 66 address. If any addresses are found, they will be saved in the `found.txt` file in the same directory.

7. **Proof of Work**: The other three addresses are used as proof of work, so be sure to keep the `found.txt` file safe until the scanning process is completed.

8. **Addresses and Private Keys**: If puzzle 66 addresses are discovered, they will be saved in a `found.txt` file, along with their associated private keys.

## Resuming the Scanning Process

If you need to pause and resume your scanning process:

1. **Recording Progress**: After completing a certain number of ranges, your progress will be recorded in the `range.txt` file in the same directory.

2. **Resuming the Scan**: When resuming, input the last completed range as shown in the `range.txt` file when prompted by `588_ranges.exe`.

3. **Continuing from Last Point**: This will allow you to continue your scanning process from where you left off, ensuring no repetition and optimizing your effort.

# Important Notes

Before you start using the tools in this repository, please take note of the following important considerations to ensure a smooth experience:

1. **File Placement**: The successful operation of these tools is reliant on proper file placement. Please ensure that the following three files are all placed in the same folder:

   - `VanBitCrackenS1.exe`
   - `588_ranges.exe`
   - `range.txt`

   Placing these files in separate directories or folders could lead to unexpected errors.

2. **Troubleshooting**: While we have taken care to ensure that these tools function effectively, technology can sometimes be unpredictable. If you encounter any errors, issues, or unexpected behavior, please don't hesitate to reach out.
